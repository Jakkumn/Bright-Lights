Bright-Lights
=============

This is an effort to build a modular system that mimics the functionality of the Philips Hue technology.
A server will run on a Raspberry Pi base station that can communicate with an array of wirelessly connected Arduino controlled lights.
The base station contains a 'known' list of connected lights and attempts to verify against each light. The base station also contains the present state.
